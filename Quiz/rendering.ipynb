    "# Quiz \\#3: Rendering Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic graphics in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to draw various shapes into images. In later exercises, these shapes are moved, rotated, and eventually made in \"3D\" (perspective projection). This is a great opportunity to learn the wonderful `numpy` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example output\n",
    "\n",
    "Using my code from this quiz, I created some \"spheres\" and made them orbit (rotate) around the origin, here it's the sun. As you can see, the illusion of distance comes from growing and shrinking the circles.\n",
